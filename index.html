            <h3><span id="typing"></span></h3>
            <p>I am an environmental enthusiast with a knack for computer programming.
                I love honing in new skills and developing them to accomplish my goals:
                use the power of data to support a more sustainable and resilient planet.</p>

            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a Ph.D. candidate in Environmental Engineering at University of Rhode Island. I am in my final year
                in my program looking forward to transitioning into industry and applying all that I have learned thus far in academia.
            </p>
            <p>
                I started my journey in Newport, Rhode Island, a small city with beautiful coastlines and a vibrant environment.
                Growing up in Newport was a treat, as it provided bountiful experiences. I am most grateful for the opportunities
                I had at a young age to learn to sail at Ida Lewis Yacht Club. I fell in love with the sport and started racing competitively,
                finding success at regional, national, and international events. I never looked back and couldnâ€™t get enough time on the water,
                knowing it was something I wanted to commit the rest of my life to.
            </p>
            <p>
                My high school education was at a Portsmouth Abbey School, a benedictine catholic boarding school, in which I enrolled as a day student.
                The school was amazing for a teenager, bringing together students from all around the world to share cultures and experiences.
                The curriculum was majorly focused on the liberal arts, although important, did not necessarily correspond with my analytical
                and mathematical way of thinking. Regardless, the four years at the Abbey gave me the roots I needed to mature socially and intellectually.
            </p>
            <p>
                Engineering, sailing, and a desire to venture from the small state of Rhode Island brought me to the George Washington University in
                Washington, D.C. I enrolled as a systems engineer with a goal of engineering versatility. The curriculum taught me statistics,
                computer science, and engineering management, all essential skills that can be applied to any engineering project, no matter the industry.
                A passion for sustainability drove me to minor in the field to gain insights on how to integrate my engineering background for a more
                sustainable environment. I also sailed for the GW varsity sailing team, devoted many hours and finding much success at the highest level of the sport.
            </p>
            <p>
                The combination of the engineering curriculum and the sailing team was intensive. It was my decision to spend some time traveling after my graduation.
                I joined a sailing team that brought me to Cascais, Portugal for 2 months which was a surreal experience. Afterwards, I toured other parts of Europe,
                including Ireland and the Netherlands.
            </p>
            <p>
                My desire to build a more resilient and sustainable planet drove me to a new journey at the University of Rhode Island in the Department of
                Civil & Environmental Engineering. I was fortunate to join an amazing research group called Water for the World and advisor, Dr. Vinka Craver.
                Although my initial plan was to pursue a M.S., I quickly realized how much academia has to offer. The resources and learning environment at URI,
                particularly in our department, is unrivaled, making the decision easy to stay for a Ph.D. My time at URI has pushed me to broaden my horizons,
                including learning water and analytical chemistry, something I never thought I would do. Naturally, my computer-based mindset took over and I
                started learning GIS and honing my programming skills. Now I am able to utilize the power of spatial data analytics to target environmental solutions.
                My specific research focuses on stormwater pollution. I have developed simulation models predicting the transport of pollutants and optimization
                techniques to enhance street sweeping programs to reduce stormwater pollution.
            </p>
            <p>
                On a more personal note, I still love to sail and try to race competitively as much as I can. However, controversial to my younger self,
                I have learned the importance of balance, so I try to limit my time on the water and mix in other hobbies.
                I also love to mountain bike, road bike, ski, play golf, play chess, listen to music, play with my dog (Mack), and just generally remain adventurous.
            </p>
